<https://symbol.technetium.be> is a little less dumb website 
forked from <https://symbol.wtf> he made 
so it would be easier to copy symbols we usually have to Google.

I added functionality to drag-and-drop symbols
and the option to save and load collections.

You're welcome to open a PR adding new symbols and collections and other improvements.
take a look in the `symbol` directory for an idea of how to do that.
